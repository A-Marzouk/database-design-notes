# Logical database structure:
### The logical structure of a database is represented using a diagram known as the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). 

### It is a visual representation of how the database will be implemented into tables during physical database design, using a Database Management System (DBMS) like MySQL or Oracle, for example. 
---
### There are many tools you can use to mae the ER Diagram and export to SQL or just to view it for the team.
---
### Part of the logical structure is how the tables are related to each others: (cardinality of relationships)     
- One-to-one relationships 
- One-to-many relationships 
- Many-to-many relationships
